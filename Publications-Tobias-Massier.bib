  Abstract                 = {Abstract Today the implication of buildings' electricity demand on the outdoor climate around buildings is not fully understood. For tropical cities like Singapore, where air-conditioning is required throughout the year and high rise buildings irregularly alternate with lower buildings, the distribution of this so called anthropogenic heat emissions in time and space is determining the local and overall contribution to the urban heat island (UHI). In the absence of detailed measurements calculating the local consumption can be challenging. We present a methodology which combines a top-down disaggregation of sectoral electricity consumption with a bottom-up geographic information system (GIS) derived building database for obtaining anthropogenic heat emission maps with high spatial resolution. The database has been validated through control samples. Using the example of Singapore we can show that heat emissions are more inhomogeneous and higher in magnitude than previously estimated. Our method can now be employed to generate better \{UHI\} models by identifying areas with significant anthropogenic heat emissions.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, power systems have experienced various changes, the most important one being the increase in the share of highly variable renewable energy supply (RES). To counteract the variability of RES, provision of flexibility from the demand side seems to be a viable option. In this paper, the heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system, mostly installed in medium to large sized office buildings, is selected to provide demand side flexibility. A model predictive control (MPC) scheme in a receding horizon environment is deployed to provide an economic operation of the building, while respecting comfort constraints of dwellers. Furthermore, robustness is introduced in the MPC scheme to participate in both the energy and reserve market. Simulations are performed to demonstrate the performance of the developed controller under various price signals. In doing so, the controller is also evaluated with respect to its sensitivity towards economical and technical constraints. The National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) is used as a case study and the most important parameters governing the challenges for integrating demand side flexibility in the grid are pointed out.},

  Abstract                 = {Liberalized markets provide opportunities for load aggregators to reduce their operating cost by participation in the wholesale electricity market. Reduction in operating cost result from shifting flexible loads based on the electricity price and also from incentives paid for ancillary service provision. Increased penetration of distributed renewable generation could help distribution system operators (DSO) reduce energy losses and increase network reliability. On the other hand, variability of renewable sources introduce additional challenges that need to be addressed in order to reduce their adverse effects on the power system. This work proposes an energy management system for aggregation of controllable loads in the distribution system. Local generation uncertainties are considered using model predictive control (MPC). The goal of the controller is to provide a schedule for the controllable loads while considering both local solar photovoltaic (PV) generation and provision of ancillary services. A case study based on the National Electricity Market of Singapore (NEMS) is presented to validate the proposed method.},

These are vehicles using petrol, diesel and compressed natural gas (CNG) as well as battery electric vehicles (BEVs). First, characteristics are derived for using the vehicles as taxis in Singapore. Then the upstream emissions of fuel and electricity supply are assessed in a well-to-tank (WTT) analysis and combined with the tank-to-wheel (TTW) emissions from fuel combustion in the engine. Electricity is found to cause least emissions per driven kilometre followed by CNG and diesel, whereas petrol ranks worst. The GHG emissions caused by the production of the respective vehicles are also analysed showing that BEVs cause highest emissions mainly due to the necessary battery production. However, after a total life-time mileage of 1.1 million km, the BEV taxi shows lowest emissions followed by the CNG vehicle. A brief sensitivity analysis proves that this result is quite stable and it shows that the vehicle consumption, the emission factor of the electricity generation in Singapore and the cycle stability of the battery have the greatest influence on the overall results.},

  Abstract                 = {Using Singapore{\rq}s solar potential to produce electricity could increase its energy independence and reduce the specific CO2 emissions of its power supply. Thereby, energy storage technologies offer the opportunity to increase the usage of electricity from solar PV during power demand peaks. This would lead to more efficient power plant use and less required residual generation capacity. In this paper we analyse the power generation capacity that can be replaced by solar PV in combination with energy storage. In our research, we use a linear programming model of Singapore{\rq}s power supply that optimizes power generation and storage according to minimal total cost. To determine the power generation by solar PV we use direct measurements of solar irradiation in Singapore. Results show that generation capacity can be replaced by solar PV most efficiently with lower storage sizes and lower solar PV capacity installed. By installing 5 GW of solar PV installed and a storage capacity of 1000 MWh, up to 750 MW of generation capacity 
could be replaced.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines options for the power systems of Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore to cover their demand for electricity in 2035 focusing on the reduction of CO2 emissions related to power generation. The power demand of these countries will increase dramatically in the next years, which entails the risk of an enormous growth of CO2 emissions. In this study, we use a linear programming model that optimises power systems in hourly time steps by minimising their total generation and transmission costs. In various scenarios, we analyse the effects of different limitations of CO2 emissions on the power supply. Even without CO2 restrictions, the full power generation potential of geothermal and hydro is exploited. Moreover, CO2 emissions rise from 202 million tons in 2012 to 880 million tons of CO2 in 2035 as coal-fired power generation is expanded tremendously. The most cost-efficient way to reduce CO2 emissions is to shift the power generation from coal to gas first and to construct capacities of solar PV and wind subsequently. Possible grid extensions between the three countries have only a moderate effect on the total cost of the power system.},

Formulated as a quadratic constraint program, it minimizes total charging cost, consisting of charging electricity cost and battery aging cost. Cycle battery aging tests are conducted and used to analyze and model the battery aging behavior. The optimization model is applied to a sample of EVs in Singapore and four different scenarios are evaluated. The resulting battery aging cost accounts for a substantial share of the total charging cost, i.e., between 52\% and 93\%. Therefore, an inclusion of battery aging into the intelligent controlling of EV charging is crucial.},
